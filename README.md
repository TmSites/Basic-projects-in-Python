🎮 Simple Python Console Games

This is my first Python project 🎉
It is a small console-based program that includes a password login system and three mini games.

🔐 Login System

User must enter the correct password (uppercase name).

Maximum 3 attempts allowed.

If correct → access granted.

If wrong → program stops.

👋 Greeting

After successful login:

User enters their name.

Program greets the user.

🎲 Game Options

After login, you can choose one of three options:

1️⃣ Mirror Game (Sentence Game)

Enter:

An adjective

A plural noun

A celebrity

The program creates a short funny sentence using your words.

2️⃣ Random Recommendation

Choose between:

📚 Book

🎵 Song

🎬 Film

Then select a category and the program randomly chooses one for you.

Categories include:

Action, Comedy, Historic, Cartoon (Films)

Sad, Study, Vivacious (Songs)

Fiction, Non-Fiction, Detective (Books)

3️⃣ Ask Question (Mini Quiz)

Multiple choice answers

This project may look simple, but it is my first step into programming.
I am learning and improving every day!
